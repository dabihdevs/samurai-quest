# samurai-quest
A simple Zelda-like RPG game created using the pygame package.

At current stage the game shows:
- A terrain map
- collideable objects and boundaries (the player cannot leave the map or step into water)
- a player icon which is animated during actions
- the player is able to attack
- the player can switch between 2 weapons (katana and lance)
- health and energy bar appears on top left of the screen (with colors)
- XPs appear on the bottom right of the screen
- the player posesses game statistics

I'm using the pygame package and the map-creator software Tiled. The tileset, characters and fonts I used I've taken from NinjaAdventure by Pixel Boy: https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack
